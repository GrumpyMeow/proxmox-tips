# Introduction
For a few years i've been using Zigbee2MQTT which did work fine. But during some refactoring of my homeserver i wanted to switch to ZHA as it's integrated in Home Assistant.
Unfortunatly devices are becomming unavailable and seem to be dropping of the network. So now i'll be switching back to Zigbee2MQTT.
