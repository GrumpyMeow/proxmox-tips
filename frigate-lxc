# Introduction
I've tried many different apps to monitor my security camera, but i keep on comming back to Frigate and it's free.
* I found the UI of Shinobi counter-intuitive. Also the live-stream was very much delayed. I chose to switch to Frigate again when the Testflight-period expired of the Shinobi-iOS app.

# Create container
1. I used the TTeck Docker script to create the container with: `bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/raw/main/ct/docker.sh)"`
2. During the script i chose "Debian 12", hostname "frigate", disable ipv6
3. I also chose to make the container "Privileged". This as i intend to give the container access to my GPU.
4. I also had to choose the option "enabled fuse OverlayFS". This as my Proxmox host is using ZFS.
5. I choose NOT to install "Portainer" or the "Portainer agent"
6. I chose to install "Docker Compose"
